Strace Exercise - EduRange 2014 - Kahea Hendrickson


SYNOPSIS

    This exercise will teach you diagnostic tools for understanding processes on
    a Unix-like machines. All work can and should be done in the terminal. The
    exercise is designed to accessible to someone who has never worked in a 
    terminal before.
    
RESOURCES

    Strace
    
DEFINITIONS

    1. man page - software documentation found on Unix{/like} operating systems

	1. system calls (syscalls) - the interface between an application and the 
	   kernel.

	2. strace - a command line program that intercepts and records the system 
	   calls of a process.

    3. PATH - a shell variable containing a colon seperated list of paths 

EXAMPLES

    How to use commands below. When you see a string between less than (<) and 
    greater than (<) like "<file>" replace that with an appropriate value.

    1. View man page for strace

         $ man strace 
    
    2. View directory structure information

         $ man heir 

    3. View shell path
   
         $ echo $PATH

    4. Find a file named "mkdir" look in "/bin" directory 

         $ find /bin -name mkdir
       
    5. Redirect strace output to stdout (see 'man stdout')
    
         $ strace <path_to_executable> 2>&1 >/dev/null
       
    6. Pipe command output string to file.
    
         $ <command_that_prints_output> >> foo.txt
         
         e.g.
         
         $ echo 'foo' >> foo.txt
       
    5. Find a string in a file?
    
         $ grep <pattern> <file>
         
         or
         
         $ cat <file> | <pattern>
    

QUESTIONS-LEVEL-0 (Primer)

	1. Name 5 syscalls. (EX:1, DEF:1, Hint: find the man page for syscalls) 

    2. What is the second directory your shell looks for executables 
       (EX:3, DEF:3)

	3. Where are executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to 
	   bring the system up or repair it located?

    4. Where is the strace program located? (EX:4)
    
    5. What option in strace counts the number of syscalls?
    
    .
    .
    .
    
QUESTIONS-LEVEL-1
    
    1. What is the name of the executable in the file "strace1"? 
    
       The arguments to the execv function call have been replaced with "*". 
       (Hint look for unique system calls then compare with an strace of the 
       system call you think it might be. 'open' and 'write' system calls are 
       often good leads.)

    2. Same as above for "strace0"
    
    3. How many calls to 'open' does "strace0" make?
    
    .
    .
    .
        
QUESTIONS-LEVEL-2

    1. The file "strace_mixed" contains interleaved function calls from two 
       executables. Which two executables are they?
       
    .
    .
    .
       
QUESTIONS-LEVEL-MASTER

    1. The file "strace-x" contains interleaved function calls from two 
       executables. Name the two programs and which function calls belong to 
       which program.
       
    .
    .
